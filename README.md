# Omnicopy_to_output

Provides a generalized implementation for a "post build copy" operation, which isn't well-supported in rust at time of
writing. This crate is inspired by https://github.com/prenwyn/copy_to_output, but implements more managed helpers +
addresses some of the missing scenarios (again, at time of writing).

If any scenarios are missing, please contribute!

See [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/omni_copy_to_output) for full details.
